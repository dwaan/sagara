            <p>Xinix has made the strategic decision to establish PT Sagara Xinix Solusitama as a legal entity, adopting
                Xinix Technology as our primary identity. Our core focus remains on innovative technologies that cater
                to all client needs.</p>
            <p>The formalization of Xinix Technology's office has enhanced our readiness to tackle various client
                challenges. Our new office environment fosters creativity and innovation in the development and
                implementation of projects tailored to our clients' needs. We have also initiated the adoption of Agile
                methodologies in our development processes to better identify client requirements, deliver superior
                solutions, and ensure on-time project completion.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the importance of proximity and connectivity with our clients, we have relocated our office
                from an area outside Jakarta to Rasuna, Kuningan in Jakarta, to better serve and engage with our
                clients.</p>

            <p>Consistently growing and thriving, our business expansion necessitated/h3e relocation of our office to a
                more spacious and strategically located area in Tebet. In the same year, we embarked on the development
                of our in-house PHP framework, which now serves as the foundational cornerstone for all our project
                developments. With this framework in place, we've accelerated project delivery timelines. We also began
                introducing responsive design technology to our clients, offering comprehensive solutions that enhance
                website traffic.
            </p>
            <p>As our business continued to flourish, we recognized the need for even larger office space, prompting our
                relocation to Mampang. We initiated a corporate culture shift by instituting Friday workshops, promoting
                the exchange of knowledge and expertise among our employees. This was a period of innovative leaps, with
                the
                launch of our Ark PHP framework that supports our agile methodology, and the beginning of our journey
                into mobile app development.
            </p>
            <p>Building on our previous year's experience, we intensified our research and development efforts, yielding
                a collection of top-tier frameworks. This includes Bono, designed for PHP-based system development; Xin,
                tailored for hybrid mobile app development; and Naked, serving as our UI framework.</p>

            <p>Following an intensive phase of technological development, we redirected our business focus towards
                custom solutions. This allowed us to cater to clients with unique business processes. As our evolving
                focus
                began to expand, we ventured into new sectors such as multimedia, infrastructure, and online retail. In
                this
                transformative year, we underwent an identity shift, rebranding ourselves as Sagara.</p>
            <p>As a testament to the evolution of our technologies, we launched updates to our framework, introducing
                Bono 2, Xin 2, and Naked 1. This period saw the introduction of several of our mobile applications,
                including
                'Kamus Pelayaran,' 'Hi-Style,' 'Nahjul Balagha,' and 'Ilmu Tadjwid.'</p>
            <p>Our business strategy became more refined, offering tailor-made solutions while internally restructuring
                and enhancing employee well-being. These changes enabled us to better serve our clients, with a focus on
                delivering optimal results.</p>
